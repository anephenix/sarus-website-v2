Here are some Frequently Asked Questions.


## What is Sarus?

A Javascript library that makes WebSockets more resilient to unexpected disconnections. Sarus acts as a wrapper around the WebSocket API, and adds some convenient features.

## Why use Sarus instead of WebSockets directly?

WebSockets are great for realtime data transmission, but they are very brittle when it comes to handling interruptions to network connectivity.

To handle that, you end up having to write code to manage:

- Replacing closed WebSocket instances with new ones.
- Attaching event listener functions to new WebSocket instances that are created when existing WebSocket instances close.
- Managing message delivery in case a WebSocket connection unexpectedly closes.

Sarus handles all that for you, so you can focus on building your application.
