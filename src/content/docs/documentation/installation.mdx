Below are instructions for different package managers and server-side environments.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="NPM">
```shell
npm i @anephenix/sarus
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">
```shell
yarn add @anephenix/sarus
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
```shell
pnpm i @anephenix/sarus
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Deno">

deno install npm:@anephenix/sarus
```
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Bun">

bun install @anephenix/sarus
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Trying out the source code directly

There is a way in NPM using `npm link` to load a local copy of the Sarus source code into your project for testing and development purposes.

1. Clone the Sarus repository from GitHub: 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/anephenix/sarus.git
```

2. Navigate to the Sarus directory and install its dependencies:

```shell
cd sarus
npm install
```

3. Build the Sarus source code:

```shell
npm run build
```

4. Link the Sarus package in whatever code repository you want to use it in:

```shell
cd <PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT>
npm link <PATH_TO_SARUS_REPO>
```

5. Now you can import Sarus in your project as usual:

```javascript
import Sarus from '@anephenix/sarus';
```

If you are trying out changes you have made to the Sarus source code, you will need to rebuild Sarus each time you make a change, by running `npm run build` in the Sarus repository directory.
